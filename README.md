# Operating-Systems---XV6
This repo contains xv6 code and series of tasks done during my time learning about xv6 operating system.

HW - 1 : This assignment will make you more familiar with how to build simple Unix programs with Makefiles, and debug them with GDB.

HW - 2 : This assignment will teach you how to use the Unix system call interface and the shell by implementing a small shell, which we will refer to as the 5460/6450 shell.

HW - 3 : This assignment will make you more familiar with organisation of ELF files.

HW - 4 : This assignment will teach you to build a minimal bootable code that boots on real hardware into C.

HW - 5 : This homework asks you to extend the xv6 kernel with several simple system calls.

HW - 6 : This homework asks you to extend xv6 with support for POSIX threads.
